## About

_zeitfetch_ is a neofetch implementation in Rust aiming to be near instantaneous, with the least amount of dependencies possible. 

Considering the shortage of fully cross platform screenfetch solutions (including Windows shells) this crate aims to fill that gap.

It's in very early stages in the moment, and support for Windows 10, Windows 11, Mac OS X, Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora is planned for the time being.

## Features

Fully cross platform compatible with Windows, macOS (almost there), and most Linux distros.

## Installation

As soon as the first release hits I'll likely update this. Ops!
## Contribution 

If you feel like contributing to _zeitfetch_, feel free to fork it and open up a PR. There are no particular coding guidelines so any improvements you can think of are fine.

Current to-be-implemented list:
* Proper macOS implementation (I'm off my Mac system for a while);
* CPU and GPU information (not working from sys_info, apparently);
* More distro ASCII Art in hex escape code format.
## Disclaimer for ASCII logos

Most of the ASCII art from _zeitfetch_ is not originally made by me, only slightly modified here and there.

If any artists feel like this is an issue in particular, please feel free to drop me an email @ [henriquevt98@gmail.com](mailto:henriquevt98@gmail.com) and I'll remove any infringing works ASAP.

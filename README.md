# zeitfetch
Terminal screenfetch implementation in Rust.

Considering the shortage of fully cross platform screenfetch solutions (including Windows shells) this crate aims to fill that gap.

It's in very early stages in the moment, and support for Windows 10, Windows 11, Mac OS X, Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora is planned for the time being.

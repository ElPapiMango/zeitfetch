## About

_zeitfetch_ is a [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) implementation in Rust aiming to be near instantaneous, with the least amount of dependencies possible.

Considering the shortage of fully cross platform screenfetch solutions (including Windows shells) this crate aims to fill that gap.

It's in early stages at the moment, and support for Windows 10, Windows 11, Mac OS X, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora and Arch is implemented for the time being, with more on the way. 

If your Linux distribution is not listed/not being actively tested on, most likely it will be missing a dedicated OS logo, so an ASCII rendition of [Tux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux_(mascot)) will be displayed instead.


## Features

Fully cross platform compatible with Windows, macOS (almost there), and most Linux distros.

## Installation

With **Cargo** installed, run: 

```bash
cargo install zeitfetch
```
## Contribution 

If you feel like contributing to _zeitfetch_, feel free to fork it and open up a PR. There are no particular coding guidelines so any improvements you can think of are fine.

To run the development environment, make sure you have both **Rust** and **Cargo** installed.
After that, in the root directory, run: 

```bash
cargo run
``` 

Current to-be-implemented list:
* Proper macOS implementation (I'm off my Mac system for a while, help would be really appreciated here);
* GPU information (mixed results with native Linux builds, left it off for the time being);
* More distro ASCII Art in hex escape code format;
* Some refactoring here and there.
